# Inventory Management System
Simple store's inventory or products management program for small stores in C programming language.  <br /> <br /> 
This program will keep track of different products, their price, and their current number of units in stock. <br /> 
It allows end user to print the entire inventory, add stock to the inventory, and buy products. <br /> <br /> 

List of source and header files: main.c, defs.h, inventory.c, user_interction.c <br />
To compile: gcc -o main main.c inventory.c user_interction.c defs.h <br />
To run: ./main <br /><br />
